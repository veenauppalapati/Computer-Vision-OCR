# Side Quest! Train the Donut!
This branch is used to attempt to train the Donut model locally. As of this last update at least one epoch has successfully trained, however the results leave much to be desired.
This should not be particularly surprising considering that a single epoch of training was performed on a maximum of 40 images with very specific prompts. Future work is to add to the dataset 
and to train for longer than 1 epochs once memory leaks are resolved.
